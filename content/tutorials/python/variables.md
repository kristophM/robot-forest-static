# Python Variables

Python variables are created as soon as you define them and don't need to be
initialized, nor do their types need to be specified.

[Put these as 'REPLS']?

```python
num_apples = 5 # initialized automatically as type "int"
greeting = 'Hallo' # initialized automatically as type string?
avg = 6.4 # initialized automatically as type float?
print(num_apples, greeting, avg)
# TODO: put in print typeof to verify
```

### Tip: Determine the type of a variable

Use `type()`

### Tip: Escaping quotes and other characters

## Variable Name Rules

Variables in Python have the following rules:

* They must start with a letter

* They must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores

* They are case sensitive
