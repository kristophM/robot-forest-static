# Installation on your local machine

This tutorial provides embedded consoles for you to perform python exercises without
installing it on your local machine, however, if you'd like to install Python locally,
you may follow the instructions below.

## Check for previous version of Python installed

Many machines these days come already shipped with Python. Run the following command
from a terminal to check for existence of python:

```bash
python -v
```

If the output shows a version, you have Python installed. If not, follow the steps below.

## Anaconda method (recommended)

Anaconda is a framework and package manager for Python with an emphasis on solutions
for data scientists. It comes with a suite of tools for data science so it's
recommended if you're going to be using Python for machine learning and data science.
Furthermore, Anaconda has its `conda` package manager and the ability to set
environment variables. Learn more about Anaconda and package managers
[here](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Homebrew (Mac)

If you have Homebrew installed on your Mac, run the following command in a shell:

```bash
brew install python3
```

## Download (Linux/Windows/Mac)

Go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) and follow the instructions for installing Python.
