# Python Casting

Casting in Python is typically performed by using constructor functions. Below
you see how numerical types get converted into strings and vice versa.

[Examples]

## Implicit vs Explicit Type Casting

*Implicit type casting* happens when an operation you execute in Python forces a
variable to become another type

[Ex. 1 + 2.5, "number of apples is: " + 1]

*Explicit type casting* happens when you define a cast in the code outright. It takes
the form of `(required_data_type)(expression)`.

[Ex. int("5")]
