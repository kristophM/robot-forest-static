# Python Data Types

Python has very few primitive types: int, float, string, and boolean

## Python Numeric Types

Python has three types of numbers in its core library:

* int

* float

* complex

### Int

Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, with unlimited length. It's not
necessary to specify the precision bits (8, 16, 32, 64) like in other languages,
as Python handles memory management automatically.

### Float

Floating point numbers are numbers, positive and negative that contain at least
one decimal place. Again, specifying the precision is not necessary in Python.

[Example. Note can use decimal, convert int to decimal, and use sci notation
]

### Complex

Complex (a.k.a. "imaginary") numbers are written with a "j" to specify their
imaginary component.

## Python String Variables

String variables can be defined either using single or double quotes.

Why are there both single and double quotes then? (Show quotes)

## Python Boolean

# Null
