# Python Collections
Python allows for 4 types of collections: *list*, *tuple*, *set*, and *dictionary*.

|            | Ordered? | Can change values? | Allows duplicates? |
|------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| List       | Yes      | Yes                | Yes                |
| Tuple      | Yes      | No                 | Yes                |
| Set        | No       | No                 | No                 |
| Dictionary | No       | Yes                | No                 |

# Lists

Lists are *ordered* collections of values, which can be changed. Python
doesn't ship with native support for arrays, but lists work fine for most
applications.

Difference between lists and arrays. See [numPy] for more info on arrays.
