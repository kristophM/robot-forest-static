# Python Error Handling

Python handles exceptions in a similar manner to other languages using `try`,
`except`, and `finally`.

The `try` block allows you to write code that has the potential of raising an exception.

The `except` block intercepts the exception before a crash is about to occur, and
lets you handle the exception.

The `finally` block executes no matter what, at the end of the try-except block.

## Handle the Exception

## Handle Multiple Exceptions

## Else

## Finally
