# Python Iterators

An *iterator* in Python is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning it has a
countable number of values. Examples of iterables are Lists, Tuples, Sets, and
Dictionaries--all the collections in Python.

The technical definition of an iterator in Python is that it conforms to the
_iterator_ protocol, meaning that it responds to `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.
