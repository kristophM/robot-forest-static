# Python Syntax and Idioms

Unlike the highly idiomatic syntax found in Ruby, ES6 Javascript, and some
other languages, Python has few idioms. Furthermore, the syntax is very
readable, and most functions are written nearly in plain English.

## Syntax

The most notable characteristics of Python syntax are:

* **Indentation:** Blocks (aka functions) and control flow (if, while, for loops)
are delineated using indentation, rather than curly braces (C++, Java, C#, Javascript)
or do/end (Ruby).

* **Preference for snake case:** Variable and function names with multiple words
prefer "snake casing" (similar to Ruby), compared to the "camel casing" found in
most other languages (Javascript, C++, Java). Classes should be in Pascal Case, and
constants should be in upper snake case.

* **No semicolons needed:** End of line statements do NOT need to be terminated by
colons. If you want to have multiple statements on the same line however, you
may use semicolons to separate them.

* **Overflowing lines can be split up using a backslash:** If you have a line that
is getting too long, you may break it up using the "\" character.

* **Return is required?:** sdflkjsdfl

Besides the above rules (especially "Indentation"), few rules exist for Python
code syntax.

## Idioms

Python may not be an opinionated (and idiom-riddled) language (compared to, say, Ruby),
however, some guidelines exist for writing "good" Python code, and some idioms
will help speed up your programming as well.

* **Chained comparison operators:** Be wary of putting too many logical operators
(AND, OR) in your conditional statements.

* **Underscores:** Fill this in 

* **Use Falsy & Truthy:**

* **The "in" keyword:**
In

* **Python's Unique Ternary operator:**

* **Mutliple Assignment:**

* **and instead of &&:**
